## 👋 Introduction

Welcome to **Sanjeevani Bharat**! We built this application with a simple yet powerful mission: to make healthcare guidance accessible, understandable, and immediate for everyone, especially our seniors.

Imagine having a doctor, a pharmacy, and a caretaker in your pocket 24/7. That's Sanjeevani. Whether you need to ask a health question in your local language, order medicines, or just need a reminder to take your pills, Sanjeevani is here for you.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **🤖 AI Health Assistant**: Powered by **Google Gemini**, our empathetic chatbot answers your health queries instantly. It's designed to be safe, helpful, and easy to talk to.
*   **🆘 Emergency SOS**: In critical moments, help is just one tap away. The SOS button instantly shares your live GPS location with emergency contacts.
*   **💊 Smart Pharmacy**: Browse and "order" essential medicines through our integrated store. Includes a **realistic Mock Payment Gateway** to simulate the complete checkout experience.
*   **🔔 Pill Reminders**: Never miss a dose again. Set daily reminders for your medications and track your adherence.
*   **📊 Vitals Dashboard**: Keep an eye on your heart rate, blood pressure, and sugar levels in a clean, easy-to-read interface.
*   **☁️ Cloud Sync**: Powered by **Firebase**, your profiles and reminders are safely backed up to the cloud, so you never lose your data.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

We used the latest modern web technologies to build a fast and responsive app:

*   **Frontend**: React.js (Vite)
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (for that beautiful, clean look)
*   **AI Engine**: Google Gemini API (gemini-2.0-flash)
*   **Backend & Database**: Firebase Firestore
*   **Icons**: Lucide React
